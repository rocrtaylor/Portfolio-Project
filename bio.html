    <h1>Me</h1>
    <section>
        <p>Yeah, so my name is Roc and I build digital stuff. WebDevelopment and iOS. I came into tech after working as
            a diver, welder, and pg
            technician. I got banged up and had a bunch of surgeries through the years and that ended my blue collar
            life.
        </p>

        <p>I got into sales and marketing were I learned about digital advertising and thought it was really cool. I
            didn't have the opportunity until the nice people at General Assembly and Microsoft gave me a scholarship on
            account of
            being banged up and being an alcoholic and addict for 25+ years. </p>

        <p>
            <li>Life is beautiful when you let it be.</li>
            <li>Everyone brings something special to the table, so never count anyone
                out. </li>
            <li>You are more than the
                sum of your life experiences.</li>
            <li>You are special</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            So that's a little about me and what I believe.
