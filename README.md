# Portfolio-Project
This is my Portfolio Project, there are many like it but this one is mine.
It is built with HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery.
The approach to this project, being my first was to build to the MVP specs. Utilizing the technology up to this point in class. Nothing fancy, just functional.
The remaining bug is the hover effect launches twice, couldn't fiqure that one out.
